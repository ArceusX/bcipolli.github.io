<p>
  My name is Ben Cipollini.  I'm a post-doctoral researcher
  in the <a href="http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/">Computer Science &amp; Engineering Department</a>
  at <a href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>.  I finished my Ph.D in
  <a href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/">Cognitive Science</a> in June 2014.
</p>

<p>
  In <a href="{{ 'projects' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">my research</a>,
  I use computational modeling to understand how and why the left and right sides
  of the brain differ, and how they interact over the corpus callosum.
  I have used neural network models (rate coded
  and spiking, feed-forward and recurrent with time delays), cross-species
  allometric analyses, and now multivariate analyses of neuroimaging and genetic
  data.

<p>
  I also <a href="{{ '/blog/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">blog</a>
  for a number of websites, with particular interest in
  <a href="{{ '/projects/roygbiv/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">interactive visualizations</a>
  of brain data.
</p>
<p>
  I have a diverse set of interests outside of academia,
  and my experiences in and out of graduate school have led me to
  create <a href="{{ '/talks/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">talks</a> on a number
  of different topics, including "what is human"?, about morality in science,
  among others.
