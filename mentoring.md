<p>
  From November 2015 through May 2016, I will be working with 12 high school students
  from the <a href="http://education.sdsc.edu/studenttech/?page_id=879" target="_blank">Mentor Assist Program</a> (MAP). This program is a new joint
  program between UCSD and SDSU, aiming to provide scientific mentorship to advanced
  junior-standing students.

<p>
  Four students are working with me to advance research projects.
  <ul>
      <li>Triet Liu is working on 3D visualizations of brain data using <a href="{{ '/projects/rogybiv/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">RoyGBiv</a> and <a href="http://brainbrowser.cbrain.mcgill.ca/">Brain Browser</a>.</li>
      <li>Frank Liao is using <a href="http://sphinx.org/">Sphinx</a> to create a website for <a href="{{ '/projects/nidata/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">nidata</a>.</li>
      <li>Howard Zhang is implementing access to the <a href="http://humanconnectome.org/">Human Connectome Project</a> (HCP) dataset in <a href="{{ '/projects/nidata/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">nidata</a>.</li>
      <li>Roshan Srinivasan is working on some of the <a href="{{ '/projects/nidata/' | prepend:site.baseurl }}">nidata</a> infrastructure and building access
      to new data sources.</li>
  </ul>
<p>

<p>
  Eight students are working on independent projects. I am meeting
  with them once every two weeks for some basic training, status updates, and
  overall group support. A list of students and planned projects will come soon!
