    <b><u>Interhemispheric connectivity across species</u></b> (unpublished) - It has been argued that the hemispheres
    are asymmetric particularly in humans because our hemispheres are more independent than in other
    mammals.  We hypothesize that the opposite must be true - in order for the two sides to do
    different things, they <i>must</i> be able to talk with each other.
    </p>

<p>
	In this project, we show that a previous reports of decreased connectivity between the hemispheres
    in large-brained animals were based on incorrect assumptions.  Using more data from the literature,
    we show that interhemispheric connections are as important, and probably
    more important, than the average connection between two parts of the brain.
