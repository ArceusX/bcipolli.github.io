  "Peer-reviewed publications" (roughly mapped to white-paper journal articles)
  is too narrow a concept for modern-age science. Contributions
  to the scientific community also include:
  <a class="emph" href="{{ '/publications/software/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">peer-reviewed software</a>,
  <a class="emph" href="{{ '/publications/blog/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">peer-viewed blog posts</a>,
  and <a class="emph" href="{{ 'publications/posters/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">interactive data visualizations</a>.
  Sadly, sometimes <i>exclude</i> journal articles, which can be
  <a href="" target="_blank">published without appropriate peer review.</a>
